### Building applications that help people and make the world a better place from South Florida!

Hi, I am Andrew (Drew) Miller and welcome to my website! I particularly like building applications in Go, Python, PHP, and C++. Although I try not to write any PHP anymore if I can avoid it (yuck!). I received my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Florida State University in fall 2012.

Since then I have worked for a Mobile Device Management company called Openpeak (2013-2016) out of Boca Raton, FL. Soon I will start working at Ultimate Software in Weston starting mid March.

My dream is to be a CTO of a small startup one day. My other dream is that I make it to my first dream before Florida becomes water world. I love making new projects from the ground up using opensource technologies, proven software engineering patterns, a simple design, and common sense (aka not reinventing the wheel). Who knows maybe my dreams will combine and I'll be making some big yacht robot boat/submarine to save everyone from the inevitable water rise.

For fun I like to tinker and hack with computer hardware and computer sciency projects. You know small projects that do barely anything, but make you smile every time you use them. See [weather station](https://www.wunderground.com/personal-weather-station/dashboard?ID=KFLFORTL56 "weather station") and [homebrew router](/ "homebrew router"). I also enjoy playing [DOTA](http://www.dotabuff.com/players/4778078 "DOTA") in my spare time with old and new friends. Although, I'll admit that I am not super great at it or anything, so don't try to recruit me if you are trying to form a "pro as" team. Besides technology stuff I enjoy snowboarding in Colorado, and boating in Florida and the Florida keys.
